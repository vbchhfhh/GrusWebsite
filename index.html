From attempting to put a chainsaw on his minions head and putting chemicals to make them feel 1247 times the pain to see if the body can handle</strong> it to designing gadgets that turn everyday items into dangerous <strong>bombs that look like phones, Gru's scientific endeavors often lead to comical mishaps. While his intentions may sometimes be a tad mischievous, there's no denying the humor in his unconventional methods.
